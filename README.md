# Bowling Scorecard

The __Bowling Scorecard__  application allows users to track their bowling game and automatically summarise the score. User adds following rolls they make, and the frames are automatically updated and the results are recalculated accordingly to the official bowling rules.

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language
- **Jest**: Testing framework
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used to execute the program and run the Jest framework 


## The API allows:

- Simple game tracking - user adds their consecutive roll records, the program takes care of events such as strikes, spares and 10th frame automatically
- Points calculation at any point of the game
- Generating scorecard at any point of the game

## Key Learnings

During the development of this project, I learned how to translate my Java skills into test-driven programming in JavaScript. I focused on keeping the code clean and modular, carefully considering the responsibilities of each part of the program.
